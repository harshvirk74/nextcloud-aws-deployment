# Cloud Infrastructure Project: Nextcloud Deployment on AWS

This project details the deployment and setup of Nextcloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS) by my group and me for a Cloud Infrastructure course. It highlights hands-on skills in managing cloud infrastructure, system administration, network setup, and user support â€“ all key for technical support and client services roles.

## Project Overview

The main goal was to get Nextcloud, a personal file sharing platform (like Microsoft 365 OneDrive), running securely and scalably on AWS. This involved building the core cloud setup, configuring servers, adding monitoring and backups, and ensuring users could access it from various devices.

## What I Did & Used

* **AWS Services:** Utilized Amazon VPC, EC2, S3, and EFS. Implemented CloudWatch for monitoring and AWS Backup for data protection.
* **Network & Server Setup:** Configured Security Groups, managed DNS and DHCP, and used Docker for Nextcloud.
* **System Management:** Handled server deployment, set up network services, and monitored system performance.
* **User Support:** Configured and tested Nextcloud access on desktops and Android devices, similar to real-world user support.
* **Problem Solving:** Addressed various setup and connectivity challenges during the project.

## Skills Gained

* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Gained practical experience with AWS (VPC, EC2, S3, EFS, CloudWatch, AWS Backup).
* **System Administration:** Performed server deployment, network service configuration (DNS, DHCP), and system monitoring.
* **Troubleshooting:** Identified and fixed technical problems with networks, server setups, and user access.
* **Organization:** Structured deployment and created clear documentation (see the project PDF).
* **Adaptability:** Navigated and configured services in a changing cloud environment.
* **Client Interaction:** Set up and tested applications for a smooth user experience.

## Project Milestones

1.  **VPC & Security Groups:** Set up secure network environments.
2.  **S3 & EFS Storage:** Configured scalable and resilient storage.
3.  **EC2 Instances & Elastic IP:** Deployed virtual servers and managed public IPs.
4.  **Nextcloud Demonstration:** Installed, configured, and validated Nextcloud, including client setup.
